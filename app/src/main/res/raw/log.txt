Having issues with display() always being called
    fixed by adding a return

Had issues with figuring out row and col specifications
    figured it out by drawing grids

My check method is only sometimes returning the correct boolean value
    I realized depending on the initial position, not all squares would be checked
    My best bet is to implement a recursive function I think

No outside help was used
